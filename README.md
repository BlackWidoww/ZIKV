Zika Modeling

Model 1 includes two competent hosts (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) and a single host species (human). Host species includes horizontal (sexual) and vertical (parent-offspring) transmission.  Model 1 was created on May 2, 2016.

Model 2 improves upon Model 1 with the addition of one dead-end host (dogs, for example). The two vectors are now thought to be one highly competent species (Ae. aegypti) and one less competent (Culex). Model 2 was created on May 10, 2016.
